# Overview
The Synapse Protocol revolutionizes the management and distribution of creative intellectual property (IP) using blockchain technology and smart contracts. It provides a decentralized framework for content monetization across formats such as films, music, games, and more.

# Key Features
Decentralized IP Monetization: Enable creators to maintain ownership while exploring custom business models (e.g., rentals, purchases).
Rights Management & Enforcement: Use smart contracts to handle licensing, compliance, and royalty distribution transparently.
Interoperability: Integrates seamlessly with protocols such as Story Protocol to expand IP management potential.
