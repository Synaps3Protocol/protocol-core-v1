## Value propositions and their interaction with the token economy

The main value proposition of MMC is our Rent/Subscription/Purchase/etc services. The business model for this value proposition is to charge a service fee. The fees will be distributed as follows: 60.00% for the treasury and 40.00% to be burnt.



## Token utilities

The token presents the following utilities:

- The token will be used as currency for the Rent/Subscription/Purchase/etc fees.
- 40.00% of the fee charged in Rent/Subscription/Purchase/etc will be used to buy back and burn the token.
- 60.00% of the fee charged in Rent/Subscription/Purchase/etc will be sent to the treasury.
- The token is a governance token, with voting power for managing the treasury funds.



## Projected organic growth of the token economy

The features detailed above have been introduced into the [Space and Tokens simulation platform](https://cenit.finance) to project the evolution of the token economy over time. These projections focus on the organic growth of the token economy, that is, on the buying and selling pressure coming from protocol users, and not on speculative trading. The full simulation results are available [here](https://spaceandtokens.ai/simulation/71136d43-fa5e-4db2-958b-6f296a4a3265).

The results projected here are based on growth assumptions for the Rent/Subscription/Purchase/etc value proposition, reflected in the following chart:

### Token price and market cap

Based on the simulation results, the MMC token is expected to evolve in value as follows:

### Supply and inflation

### Protocol fees

The following chart showcases how the fees generated by the protocol are expected to evolve over time, and how they will be distributed.

![Token fees](resources/protocol.png)

By year 4, the protocol is expected to have generated a total value of approximately $190000000 in fees. This is comes from estimating an average service fee of 5.0 %.

### Treasury

The treasury is expected to have the following profit and loss:

The treasury is expected to have the following funds under management:

By year 4, the treasury is expected to have a total value of approximately $163000000 under management, all in native tokens.
